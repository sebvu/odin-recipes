    <p>What is sinigang?</p>
    <p>
      Sinigang is a Filipino soup/stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is one of the
      more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine, and there are plenty of variations of it. In this
      variation, we are making <em>Pork</em> Sinigang! My personal favorite variation.
