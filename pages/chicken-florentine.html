      <h2>What is Chicken Florentine?</h2>
      <p>
        Chicken Florentine is a timeless dish originating from 16th-century
        France, celebrated for its indulgent, creamy sauce and tender chicken.
        This culinary classic has stood the test of time, remaining a beloved
        favorite in modern gastronomy. The dish is characterized by its rich
        flavor profile, where succulent chicken breasts are seasoned with garlic
        powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, then delicately coated in
        flour and pan-seared to golden perfection. The sauce, a heavenly blend
        of garlic, chicken broth, dry white wine, and heavy cream, is infused
        with vibrant baby spinach leaves, adding a touch of freshness to the
        velvety texture. Finished with a generous sprinkling of freshly grated
        Parmesan cheese, Chicken Florentine is a feast for the senses, sure to
        delight the whole family with its luxurious taste and elegant
        presentation.
